Welcome to my first real project in Godot, an open-world Snake game with a twist! This game was created a few years ago as I was exploring the capabilities of the Godot Engine. 

## About the Game

This is a small open-world Snake game where you control a snake in a vast environment. Unlike the traditional Snake game, this version allows you to explore an open world, encounter various challenges, and discover twelve unique endings.

## Features

- **Open World Exploration**: Move freely in a large world filled with surprises.
- **Power-Ups**: Collect various power-ups to enhance your gameplay experience.
- **Unique Challenges**: Navigate through different zones with unique obstacles and hazards.
- **Twelve Endings**: Discover and unlock twelve different endings based on your actions and achievements in the game.

## How to Play

- Collect food to grow the snake and increase your score.
- Avoid obstacles and hazards to keep the snake alive.
- Explore the world to find power-ups and hidden secrets.
- Achieve different endings by completing specific tasks and challenges.

## Endings

The game features twelve unique endings, each unlocked by completing specific challenges and tasks within the game world. Can you find them all?
